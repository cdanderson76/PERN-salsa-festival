4.  POSTGRES SQL DATABASE


A. Refer to your thumb drive to create a Postgres SQL connection string

B. Refer to your thumb drive to create an Arcjet connection string.

C. Create '/backend/config/db.js', and configure it to connect to the Postgres
   SQL

D. Go into 'server.js' and create a 'try/catch' function that will log an error
   to the console if it is unsuccessful.

   If it is successful, and if it doesn't exist, create a table called 'products'
   with the following makeup:

   -PRIMARY KEY
   -name of product
   -image
   -price (can have 10 digits for whole number, and 2 decimal places)
   -have timestamps created upon creation
   -log 'Database initialized successfully' at the end of the 'try' function

E. initialize the database, and once it is ready, run a callback function where we
   are listening to our app.


NOTE: WHEN FINISHED SUCCESSFULLY, YOU SHOULD NOW SEE A MAKEUP OF THIS DATABASE IN THE
      NEON SITE CONSOLE.  ALSO, THE 'updatedAt' FIELD WILL NOT SHOW AT THIS POINT
      SOMETHING ELSE WILL NEED TO BE DONE TO SEE THIS.
